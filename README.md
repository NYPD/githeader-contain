# githeader-contain
Ez pz GitHub header CSS to keep everything nice and central.


Check it out on the [chrome web store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/githeader-contain/pcpldafjkkcdckcdkekdacgfdbnidfpj?hl=en-US&gl=US)

## Why?
Around 10/22/2018 (2018-10-22 for non EE.UU friends) GitHub decided to make their header contents align all the way to the left and right side of the viewport. This is fine and all but users with high resolution monitors 2k+, it results in some very
wonky user experience and tons of unneeded whitespace. The rest of the site is centralized, why change the header?

## Keep in mind
This CSS extension can break at anytime GitHub decided to change the markup, perhaps they are gonna do a big site re-work.
